Introduction
The rise of AI-generated images, particularly those produced by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like StyleGAN, has blurred the lines between reality and fabrication. These synthetic images are often indistinguishable from real photographs, posing challenges in areas such as digital security, misinformation, and privacy. This project addresses these challenges by developing a CNN-based classifier capable of differentiating between real and AI-generated face images.â€‹

Features
High Accuracy: Achieves a high level of precision in distinguishing real faces from AI-generated ones.â€‹
Robust Dataset: Trained on a diverse dataset comprising thousands of images to ensure reliability.â€‹
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input images and receive instant classification results.â€‹
Dataset
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes:â€‹

Real Images: Sourced from publicly available facial datasets capturing diverse demographics.â€‹
AI-Generated Images: Produced using advanced GAN architectures to represent various styles and qualities.â€‹
This diverse dataset ensures the model learns to identify subtle differences between real and synthetic images, enhancing its generalization capabilities.â€‹

Model Architecture
The classifier utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, renowned for its efficacy in image recognition tasks. The network consists of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. Techniques such as batch normalization and dropout are incorporated to improve training stability and prevent overfitting.â€‹
