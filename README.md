# Real-vs.-AI-Generated-Face-Classification-with-CNNs-🤖👤
##📌 Project Overview

AI-generated images are trending, and spotting them before you get catfished is more important than ever! 🎭 This deep learning project harnesses the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to separate authentic human faces from AI-generated illusions with razor-sharp accuracy.

AI-generated faces are everywhere, and distinguishing real from fake is more crucial than ever. In a world where pixels can outshine reality, this project helps ensure you’re not falling for a deepfake illusion! 🔍🤖
