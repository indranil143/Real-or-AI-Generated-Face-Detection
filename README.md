# Real vs. AI-Generated Face Classification using Deep Learning 🤖👤

## 📌 Project Overview

AI-generated images are now trending or can say everywhere, and spotting them before you get catfished is more important than ever!! 🎭 
Well, this deep learning project harnesses the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to separate authentic human faces from AI-generated illusions with razor-sharp accuracy.

In a world where pixels can outshine reality, this (Getting Started) project helps ensure you’re almost not falling for a deepfake illusion! 🔍🤖
